	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Effective date: October 9, 2025</p>

	<p>
		Fressh ("the App") is provided by an individual developer ("we", "us"). This
		policy explains how the App handles information.
	</p>

	<h2>Summary</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We do not collect any personal information or analytics.</li>
		<li>The App has no backend servers; your data remains on your device.</li>
		<li>No ads and no third‑party tracking SDKs.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Data the App handles</h2>
	<p>
		The App allows you to store SSH connection details (e.g., hostnames,
		usernames, ports, and optional private keys). This information is stored
		locally on your device and is only transmitted to the servers you choose
		when you initiate an SSH session.
	</p>

	<h3>Sensitive credentials</h3>
	<p>
		Private keys, passwords, and session data never leave your device except as
		required to establish and maintain the SSH connection that you request. We
		do not upload this information to any server we control.
	</p>

	<h2>Permissions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Network access</strong>: required to connect to SSH servers you
			choose.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Local storage</strong>: used to save SSH profiles/keys if you opt
			to store them.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Clipboard</strong> (optional): used only when you copy/paste text during
			a session.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Collection, sharing, and retention</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Collection</strong>: We do not collect or process personal data.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Sharing</strong>: We do not sell or share data with third parties.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Retention</strong>: Data you save remains on your device until you
			delete it or uninstall the App.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
	<p>
		The App is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal
		information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided
		information, please contact us so we can delete it.
	</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>
		We rely on the security features of your device’s operating system and the
		SSH protocol. Protect your device with a strong passcode and keep your
		operating system up to date.
	</p>

	<h2>Third‑party services</h2>
	<p>The App does not use advertising, analytics, or social media SDKs.</p>

	<h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
	<p>
		We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this
		page with an updated effective date.
